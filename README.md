Hello! 

"The goal of this code is to simulate the orbits of different planets around the sun using real astronomical values.
We're also applying the force of gravity on each of the planets so we get an accurate elliptical orbit."

I coded along Tim's video as a way for me to practice Python, not my own project :) 
Might add changes later on as practice, but for now, this is the code with some explanation.
